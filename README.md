# Real World OOP in Python

This repository features real-world inspired Python mini projects developed using strong **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** design principles. Each project simulates a practical system like banking, shopping carts, elevators, or digital clocks — showcasing modular, maintainable, and testable code.

## Goals
- Demonstrate practical OOP usage in real-world scenarios
- Build reusable, well-structured classes with proper encapsulation
- Highlight Python class design with real-world business logic
- Showcase error handling, validation, and robust code practices
- Provide hands-on examples for learning OOP concepts

## Projects Included

### Completed Projects
- **Bank Account System** - Full-featured banking with transactions, transfers, and account management
- **Library Browsing System** - Role-based library management with inheritance

### In Progress
- **Hospital Management System** - Patient and doctor management system
- **Shopping Cart App** - E-commerce cart with inventory management

### Planned Projects
- **Elevator Controller** - Multi-floor elevator simulation
- **Student Grade Tracker** - Academic performance management
- **Digital Clock** - Time-based OOP implementation
- **Mini Cache with Expiry** - Memory management system
- **And more...**

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (recommended: Python 3.9+)
- No external dependencies required (uses Python standard library)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/noorulain276775/realworld-oop-python.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd realworld-oop-python

# Run any project demo
python bank_account/demo.py
python library_browsing_system/main.py
```

## How to Use

### Bank Account System
```bash
cd bank_account
python demo.py          # Run comprehensive demo
python bank.py          # Run basic examples
```

### Library Browsing System
```bash
cd library_browsing_system
python main.py          # Interactive library system
```

## Learning Outcomes

Each project demonstrates:
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes and controlled access
- **Inheritance**: Class hierarchies and code reuse
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and flexible interfaces
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details
- **Error Handling**: Robust input validation and exception management
- **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, and well-documented code
