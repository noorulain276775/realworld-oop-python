# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A comprehensive **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project built in Python with a modern **Tkinter GUI** interface. This system demonstrates advanced OOP concepts while providing a fully functional hospital management application.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This Hospital Management System is designed to showcase:
- **Advanced OOP principles** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- **Professional GUI development** using Tkinter
- **Real-world business logic** implementation
- **Data persistence** with JSON import/export
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation
- **Modern Python features** (Type hints, Enums, Dataclasses)

## ✨ Features

### 🏥 Core Hospital Management
- **Patient Management**: Add, edit, search, and manage patient records
- **Doctor Management**: Manage doctor profiles, specializations, and schedules
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Book, reschedule, and track appointment statuses
- **Department Organization**: Multi-department hospital structure
- **Medical Records**: Track prescriptions, diagnoses, and medical history

### 💻 User Interface
- **Modern Tabbed Interface**: Organized into logical sections
- **Interactive Data Tables**: Sortable and searchable patient/doctor lists
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live dashboard with hospital metrics
- **Search Functionality**: Find patients and doctors quickly
- **Responsive Design**: Professional-looking desktop application

### 📊 Reporting & Analytics
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Patient, doctor, appointment, and department reports
- **Data Export/Import**: JSON-based data persistence
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hospital performance metrics
- **Audit Trails**: Track all changes and appointments

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Class Structure
```
Hospital (Main Controller)
├── Patient (Data Model)
├── Doctor (Data Model)
├── Appointment (Data Model)
└── AppointmentStatus (Enum)
```

### OOP Principles Demonstrated

| Principle | Implementation | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Encapsulation** | Private attributes with getters/setters | Patient medical history, Doctor schedule |
| **Inheritance** | Base classes for common functionality | User roles, appointment types |
| **Polymorphism** | Method overriding and flexible interfaces | Status updates, report generation |
| **Abstraction** | Hidden complex implementation details | Hospital operations, data validation |

### Design Patterns
- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of data, logic, and presentation
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single hospital instance
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time updates across UI components
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic object creation for patients/doctors

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (recommended: Python 3.9+)
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- No external dependencies required

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
